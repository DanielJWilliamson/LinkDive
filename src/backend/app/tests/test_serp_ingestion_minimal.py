"""Validates that the SERP ingestion pathway increments metrics counters.

This is a lightweight behavioural test that:
 - Creates a campaign with a single keyword
 - Triggers the metrics endpoint (SERP ingestion runs in background loop)
Because the background loop timing may not have executed yet in a test context,
we simulate a direct call to the repository ingest function if available.
